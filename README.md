# MegaBan


The title says it all: one command will ban the players IGN, CID, Skin & IP address.
Be careful not to ban players with steve/alex skins...

Permissions:

`megaban (defaults to OP only)`


Commands:

`/megaban {player}`

`/megaunban {player}`

`/megaban clear`


Please note that /megaban can ONLY be used when the player to be banned is online. /megaunban {player} can be used when when the player is not online
/megaunban clears all the MegaBan data, it does NOT pardon player IGNs or IP addresses for every Megabanned player.
