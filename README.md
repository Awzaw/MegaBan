# MegaBan


The title says it all: one command will ban the players IGN, CID, Skin & IP address.
Be careful not to ban players with steve/alex skins...

Permissions:

`megaban (defaults to OP only)`


Commands:

`/megaban {player}`

`/megaunban {player}`

`/megaban clear`


##Please note:

'/megaban' can ONLY be used when the player to be banned is online

'/megaunban {player}' will pardon IGN, CID, Skin and IP Address on the next reboot

'/megaunban clear' will delete all the MegaBan data, it does NOT pardon player IGNs or IP addresses for every Megabanned player.
